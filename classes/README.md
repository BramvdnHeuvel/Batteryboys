Welcome to the readme for the map classes.
In this map, four different files can be found.
We start with an init map.
We have a battery class, which is used to load all information of a battery.
Think about the capacity it has, how much power it has left, the coordinates.
We make use of a house class, which is used to load all information about the houses.
Think about the output per house, the coordinates, whether the house is connected or not.
We also have the class map, which is used for the whole map. Here, everything will be connected, a visualization will be made.
