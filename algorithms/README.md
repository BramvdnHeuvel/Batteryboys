Welcome to the readme for the algorithms.
Here you can find an overview of all algorithms used in this case.
We have the First fit battery and first fit houses. These will connect houses and batteries in the same order that the list is presented. So, the first house will be connected to the first battery.
We make use of a hillclimber, which swaps random houses to see if it can make a cheaper neigbourhood.
It can also connect a house to a battery if it is not yet connected.
The batteryswitch will be used for finding a better place for the batteries, so the neighbourhood can become cheaper.
